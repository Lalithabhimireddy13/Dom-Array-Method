# DOM Array Methods Project

This project is designed to teach high-order array methods and DOM manipulation by fetching random users from the [randomuser.me](https://randomuser.me) API. The following array methods are used in this project:

- `forEach()`: To loop through the users and display their wealth.
- `map()`: To double the wealth of the users.
- `filter()`: To filter out only the millionaires.
- `sort()`: To sort users by their wealth.
- `reduce()`: To calculate the total wealth of all users.

## Project Specifications

1. **Fetch random users from the API**
   - Use the [randomuser.me](https://randomuser.me) API to get random user data.
   
2. **Use `forEach()` to loop and output user/wealth**
   - Display each user's name and their wealth in the DOM.
   
3. **Use `map()` to double wealth**
   - Create a new array where each user's wealth is doubled.
   
4. **Use `filter()` to filter only millionaires**
   - Filter the users to display only those whose wealth is a million or more.
   
5. **Use `sort()` to sort by wealth**
   - Sort the users by their wealth in descending order.
   
6. **Use `reduce()` to add all wealth**
   - Calculate the total wealth of all users and display it in the DOM.
